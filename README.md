# CSS Destroyer Chrome Extension

This was made when I participated in the Stupid Hackathon Thailand 4 [ SHT4 ] </br>
It's a chrome extension that beautifies(?) web pages that you visit </br>

**Won the most stupid aesthetics award**


## Version

**CSS Destroyer 1.0** add a pop up menu to your chrome browser that enables you</br>
to change the appearance of the web page you're on.

**Forever CSS Destroyer** is activated automaticly on the web page you visit</br>
THe limitation being you have to stay on that page until it finishes loading


## Installation
